# Objective

* Make it easier to teach
* Understand how computers work
* Get the basics of pipelines

## How it works

The Little Man Computer (LMC) is a virtual machine used for teaching computer architecture and programming.
It is a simplified model of a computer that has only a handful of basic instructions and a small amount of memory.
Users can write assembly language programs and execute them on the LMC simulator to gain a better understanding of how computers work.

## What are pipelines? 

Pipelines in computing are a technique that allows multiple instructions to be processed simultaneously in different stages of a pipeline.
Each stage of the pipeline performs a different operation on the instruction before passing it on to the next stage, resulting in faster execution.
For example, in a CPU pipeline, the fetch stage retrieves an instruction from memory while the decode stage interprets it, and the execute stage performs the operation specified by the instruction.

## What is a Random Access Memory?

Random Access Memory (RAM) is a type of computer memory that can be read from and written to randomly.
It is volatile, meaning that its contents are lost when power is turned off.
RAM is used to temporarily store data and instructions that the CPU needs to access quickly.
