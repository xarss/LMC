## Objective

* The Little Man Computer (LMC) provides a simplified model of a computer, making it an easy-to-understand teaching tool for computer science and programming students.

* Through working with the LMC, students gain a deeper understanding of computer architecture and the basics of pipelining, which are fundamental concepts in computer science.

* The hands-on approach to programming with the LMC provides practical experience that can be applied in real-world computer systems design and optimization.

## How it works

The Little Man Computer (LMC) is a virtual machine that operates on a stored program. It has a limited set of instructions and a small amount of memory that can be used to write assembly language programs. When a program is executed on the LMC, its instructions are fetched from memory and executed one at a time, altering the contents of memory and registers as necessary.

## What are pipelines? 

Pipelines in computing are a technique that allows multiple instructions to be processed simultaneously in different stages of a pipeline.
Each stage of the pipeline performs a different operation on the instruction before passing it on to the next stage, resulting in faster execution.
For example, in a CPU pipeline, the fetch stage retrieves an instruction from memory while the decode stage interprets it, and the execute stage performs the operation specified by the instruction.

## What is a Random Access Memory?

Random Access Memory (RAM) is a type of computer memory that can be read from and written to randomly.
It is volatile, meaning that its contents are lost when power is turned off.
RAM is used to temporarily store data and instructions that the CPU needs to access quickly.
